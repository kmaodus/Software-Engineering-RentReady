# Rent Ready - Windows Forms application

An application is intended for landlords and tenants who use apartments from these same landlords. Through the application, we want to facilitate the management of a larger number of apartments, ie buildings owned by the landlord, but we also want to modernize and speed up the payment of rent and utilities for certain consumption specified in the payment slip. Also, employees in charge of building management have an insight into the building/buildings they are obliged to manage through the application. They will be able to see the list of tenants, other employees, the consumption of each apartment, and other statistics. Implemented functionalities: registration, login, managing employees, a system for managing real estate, a system for managing tenants, a system for creating a payment slip and sending it to the appropriate e-mail, and reporting system for individual buildings and apartments.
